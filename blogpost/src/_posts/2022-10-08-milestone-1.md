## Question 1.1 Brief tutorial on downloading the dataset

<b> 1. The NHL REST API </b><br>
NHL captures very detailed data for every of its games. Starting from information about the season to standings to events in a specific game. It shares the play-by-play data, which are detailed event information of every game. The play-by-play data for every game can be obtained by hitting a GET request to the following API:
	https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/ <game_id> /feed/live/
The play-by-play data captures detailed data about events like faceoffs, shots, goals, saves, and hits. A snippet of the play-by-play data JSON response:

<img src="assets/images/jsonNest.png"><br>

<b> 2. Understanding Game ID </b><br>
<img src="assets/images/gameID.png"><br>
The Game ID can be divided into 3 parts:<br>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Starting year of the season (eg. - ‘2017’ for the season ‘2017-2018’)
</li>
  <li>Type of game (‘01’ for pre-season, ‘02’ for regular, ‘03’ for playoffs, ‘04’ for all-star)</li>
  <li>Game number - The game number varies for ‘regular’ and ‘playoffs’ games as:</li>
</ol>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Game Type</th>
    <th>Values</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Regular</td>
    <td>1 to 1271</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Playoffs</td>
    <td>The 2nd digit of the specific number gives the round of playoffs, the 3rd digit specifies the matchup, and the 4th digit specifies the game(out of 7)
</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<b> 3. Downloading the data</b><br>
The data can be downloaded using a single line of code using the `requests` package in Python as :
    response_API = requests.get('https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/'+str(game_id)+'/feed/live/')

However, to download the data for all games from 2017-2020, keep relevant checks and modularize the code, we have divided the code into different functions:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Function</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>fetch_data()</td>
    <td>Returns play-by-play data as raw JSON for a given year, game type and game number</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>is_valid_game_id()</td>
    <td>Checks whether a given game ID is valid or not</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>generate_filepath()</td>
    <td>Generates a filepath to store the JSON locally, given a year, game type and game ID</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>fetch_raw_json()</td>
    <td>Fetches a JSON file if present locally, otherwise downloads the data based on the info in filepath</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>download_via_api()</td>
    <td>Hits the NHL API to fetch the play data for a given game based on the given path</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>download_all_json()</td>
    <td>Additional utility function that downloads all play data for a given year and game type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>get_game_ids()</td>
    <td>Returns a list of game IDs fetched from the NHL API for a given year and game type</td>
  </tr>
</table>

{% highlight python %}
def fetch_data(self, year, game_type, game_number):
        '''
        To fetch the data given the year, game_type(regular or playoff), game_id
        returns: raw JSON
        '''

        game_id = year + '02' + game_number if game_type == 'R' else year + '03' + game_number

            raw_data = self.fetch_raw_json(filepath)

        if response_API.status_code == 200:
            response = response_API.json()

            with open(filepath, "w") as outfile:

## Question 2.1 Interactive Debugging Tool Description

<b>Create simple interactive tools with ipywidgets</b>

ipyWidgets is a Python library for HTML interactive widgets for Jupyter notebooks, which can create real-time responsive widgets for real-time interaction.

There are two widget types used in Project: IntSlider and Dropdown. There are a total of four widgets in the interactive tools: w_gameType; w_year; w_game_id and w_events.and values of w_game_id and w_events will change with values of w_gameType; w_year. The data transfer between widgets is shown in the figure:

## Question 4.1 Small snippet of dataframe

<img src="assets/images/tidyData_head.png"><br>

## Question 4.2 Discussion of adding actual strength to both shots and goals

The most straightfoward way would be:

<ol>
<li>For each <i>event shot</i> or <i>goal</i>, initialize 2 counters, both set to 5.</li> 

<li>Read its <i>dateTime</i> feature and go backward in the <i>liveData</i> dictionary till an <i>event</i>
 with <i>dateTime</i> more than 5 minutes behind is met.</li>
 
<li>Check if there's any <i>event</i> of type <i>penalty</i> during this 5 minutes timeframe.</li>

<li>If there's a <i>minor penalty</i>, check if its <i>dateTime</i> is within 2 minutes of current event (<i>shot or goal</i>).
If yes, check the name of <i>team</i> on which the penalty was drew, make its counter -1.
If not, do nothing.
</li>

<li>If there's a <i>major penalty</i>, check the name of <i>team</i> on which the penalty was drew, make its counter -1.</li>

<li>Create the <i>strength</i> feature for each <i>shot or goal</i> by displaying the counters of both team (team shooting on team defensing).
</li>
</ol>
## Question 4.3 Discussion of creating more features from the dataset

<ol>
<li>
A feature <i>rebound</i> can be created, it's determined by whether a <i>shot or goal</i> was shoot within 5 seconds after the previous <i>shot</i>.
</li>
<li>
A feature <i>ownGoal</i> can be created, it's determined by whether the <i>scorer</i> was from the opponent team of scoring team.
</li>
<li>
A feature <i>solo</i> can be created, it's determined by whether there are no <i>players with type Assist</i> in a <i>goal</i> event. 
</li>
</ol>
## Question 5.1 Figure comparing the shot types over all teams

Produce a figure comparing the shot types over all teams for 2016(season 2016-2017)

Overlay the number of goals overtop the number of shots. In all shooting types, the most dangerous type of shot is deflected, although it is not a common shot type, It has the most goals chance 19.80%. The most common type of shot is wrist shot, it accounts for almost half of the shots. 
We chose to use a stacked bar plot, because it can clearly compare the number of discrete categories, in our case the shot type. Then, added the percentage of points scored as the label of bars, which can show the accuracy of shot types.

<img src="assets/images/simpVisual.png"><br>

<img src="assets/images/simpVisual1.png"><br>



## Question 5.2 Figure demonstrating relationship between the distance of shot and the chance of goal

Produce a figure for each season between 2018-19 to 2020-21 to show the relationship between the distance a shot was taken and the chance it was a goal.


Obviously, the closer you are to the goal, the easier it is to score. Because in case of close shots the reaction time left for the goalkeeper will be shorter than long shots. According to the data, the highest rate of scoring shots are from the area of 10-20 feet away from the net, this area provides the best chances at getting clean shots on goal. This trend almost hasn't changed in these three seasons, but in seasons 20202021 the rate of goals from long range has increased.

We choose to use LinePlot because it can clearly show the relationship between the x and y axes, in our case its distance and goal rate. Then,  we also draw another LinePlot to show the number of shots and distance.

<img src="assets/images/simpVisual2.png"><br>
<img src="assets/images/simpVisual3.png"><br>
<img src="assets/images/simpVisual4.png"><br>
## Question 5.3 Figure showing goal percentage as function of both distance from the net and the category of shot types

Produce a figure that shows the goal percentage (# goals / # shots) as a function of both distance from the net, and the category of shot types in season 20202021.


To reduce noise, we only counted the types of shots with more than 50 times from each short distance.

At almost all distance, the Slap Shot is the most effective shot type, it have a best chance of scoring from the net to long range.(5-65 feet)

At long distance, the Wrist Shot has a greater chance of scoring.(65-85 feet)

The closer to the net, the Deflected is more effective.(5-15 feet)

Snap Shot is also effective in short to medium distance.(5-35 feet))

Overall, the most dangerous type of shooting is Slap Shot.

<img src="assets/images/simpVisual5.png"><br>

We also produce a figure that shows the number of shot types. Wrist Shot is indeed the most common way to shoot and goal. although the Snapshot has a high score rate. And, SnapShot is usually used at a mid-range.(about 55 feet)

<img src="assets/images/simpVisual6.png"><br>
<b>Notes on the team side:</b><br>
We noticed that it seemed impossible to know exactly which side the team was on the rink.

At first we tried to use the initial side of the team home in the first period to calculate the side for the rest period. Then calculate the distance from coordinate shot to net.

{% highlight python %}
#get distanceNet

df_tidy['homeTeamSide'] = np.where(df_tidy['period'] % 2 == 0, 'left', 'right')#P1 = right, P2 = left

df_tidy['awayTeamSide'] = np.where(df_tidy['period'] % 2 == 0, 'right', 'left')#p1 = left, P2 =right

df_tidy['AttTeamSide'] = np.where(df_tidy['team'] == df_tidy['home'], df_tidy['homeTeamSide'], df_tidy['awayTeamSide'])


#https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/44904/using-the-nhl-api-to-analyze-pro-ice-hockey-data-part-1

leftNetCoX = -89

rightNetCoX = 89

df_tidy['distanceNet'] = np.where(

    df_tidy['AttTeamSide'] == 'right',

    ((df_tidy['x'] - leftNetCoX)**2 + (df_tidy['y'] - 0)**2)**0.5,

    ((df_tidy['x'] - rightNetCoX)**2 + (df_tidy['y'] - 0)**2)**0.5

    )
{% endhighlight %}<br>

But then we found that the distribution of distances is very strange, in fact the vast majority of shots are taken in the half rink close to the net.

<img src="assets/images/simpVisual7.png"><br>
<img src="assets/images/simpVisual8.png"><br>

Source: https://www.omha.net/news_article/show/667329-the-science-of-scoring 

According to NHl statistics, 96% of shots happen at the half rink near the goal. So we change the logic to calculate the distance. We assume that all shots are aimed at the nearest goal, this may cause a little error in our data, but it does not change the general trend.

{% highlight python %}
"""< Det_Distance_Net. >

Determine the distance to the net based on the puck's coordinates, we assume always shoot the nearest net.

certain errors may occur, In reality about 96% are in the half near the net.

:df_tidy['x']:                      column of dataframe - coordinates X

:df_tidy['y']:                      column of dataframe - coordinates Y

:leftNetCoX = -89:                  fixed value - Net coordinates X

:rightNetCoX = 89:                  fixed value - Net coordinates Y

:return: df_tidy['distanceNet']:    new column of dataframe

"""


#https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/44904/using-the-nhl-api-to-analyze-pro-ice-hockey-data-part-1

leftNetCoX = -89

rightNetCoX = 89

#Always shoot at the nearest goal

df_tidy['distanceNet'] = np.minimum(

    ((df_tidy['x'] - leftNetCoX)**2 + (df_tidy['y'] - 0)**2)**0.5,

    ((df_tidy['x'] - rightNetCoX)**2 + (df_tidy['y'] - 0)**2)**0.5

    )

## Question 6.2 Discussion on offensive zone plots

<ol>
<li>
Almost every team tends to shoot near the net (in range -10 to +10 for x,y positions from the net)
</li>
<li>
Teams like San Jose Sharks have maintained their offensive style across multiple seasons: most shots near net or around 50 ft away from net on the left side of rink
</li>
<li>
Teams like Washington Capitals have changed their offensive style across multiple seasons: from shots mostly in the middle position of x-axis to a rather dispersed shooting area in season 2020-2021
</li>
</ol>


## Question 6.3 Discussion about the team Colorado Avalance based on comparison of their shot map during 2016-17 and 2020-21

In season 2016-2017, team Colorado Avalance has a rather low shot rate in front of net (10 to 20 ft away from net) compared to league average shot rate at the same position.

However, in season 2020-2021, team Colorado Avalance has a definitively higher than average shot rate near net, which indicates a change of playstyle. 
## Question 6.4 Discussion about the comparison between the team Buffalo Sabres and the team Tampa Bay Lightning, based on their shot maps

They both shoot around near to mid range (10 - 50 ft away from net).
Buffalo Sabres tends to shoot more on both left and right side position, but less in the middle position.
Tampa Bay, quite the opposite, tends to shoot mostly in the middle position, but less on sides.
